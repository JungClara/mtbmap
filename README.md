Web map for mountain biking and hiking based on OpenStreetMap data. It is available on [mtbmap.cz](http://mtbmap.cz/)

It shows mountain bike, cycling and hiking tracks in Europe.

Since June 2013 we offer configurable online routing service for planning MTB and hiking trips (Czech Republic only).

Installation and configuration process will be documented soon.
